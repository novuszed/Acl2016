# Acl2016
Creates a playlist for ACL


The script parses the ACL website through beautifulsoup to grab the music artists/band for the current year.
It then parses through the JSON data and later uses it to gather the data needed to compile a playlist.
It uses the YouTube API and OAUTH2 authentication provided by Google to parse the JSON data and grabs all the music videos and store them into a playlist in a way specified
by the user.
